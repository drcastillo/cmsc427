                    A specification for the turtle habitat given the breed and age. The specification 
                    should include the following: Recommended Tank Size in gallons, Tank Description, 
                    Substrate , Diet, Temperature and Lighting, and Enrichment.

                    Example Output: 
                         1. Tank Size in Gallons: 80
                         2. Tank Description: Provide an enclosure that is at least 80 gallons to accommodate the size 
                            and activity level of a 15-year-old Diamondback Terrapin. A larger tank or outdoor 
                            pond setup would be even better if space allows.
                         3. Substrate: Use a substrate that is appropriate for both the aquatic and terrestrial areas of the enclosure. 
                            For the aquatic area, you can use aquarium gravel or smooth river rocks. For the terrestrial area, 
                            use a mix of soil, sand, and moss.
                         4. Diet: Diamondback Terrapins are omnivorous and eat a variety of foods, including commercial turtle 
                            pellets, aquatic plants, leafy greens, vegetables, and occasional protein sources like insects or fish.
                         5. Temperature and Lighting: Maintain a temperature gradient in the enclosure with a water temperature of 
                            around 75-80째F (24-27째C) and a cooler area around 70째F (21째C). Provide UVB lighting for at least 10-12 
                            hours a day to help with calcium metabolism and overall health.
                         6. Enrichment: Provide hiding spots, aquatic plants, and objects for exploration to create a stimulating environment. 
                            Diamondback Terrapins enjoy exploring their environment and benefit from enrichment activities.\n\n"""),
